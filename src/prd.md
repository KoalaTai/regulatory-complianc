## Design Direction

### Visual Tone & Identity
- **Emotional Response**: Confidence, clarity, professional competence
- **Design Personality**: Professional, authoritative, modern, accessible
- **Visual Metaphors**: Clean documentation, structured information, shield/protection imagery
- **Simplicity Spectrum**: Structured complexity - rich functionality presented in organized, digestible interfaces

### Color Strategy
- **Color Scheme Type**: Professional complementary palette with navy primary and supporting earth tones
- **Primary Color**: Deep navy blue (oklch(0.25 0.08 250)) - conveys trust, authority, and stability
- **Secondary Colors**: Sage green (oklch(0.65 0.08 130)) - represents success and guidance
- **Accent Color**: Bright cyan (oklch(0.75 0.15 200)) - for CTAs and interactive elements
- **Color Psychology**: Navy builds trust, green suggests success, cyan draws attention to actions
- **Color Accessibility**: All color combinations maintain WCAG AA contrast ratios (4.5:1 minimum)
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**:
  - Background (white): Dark navy foreground (15:1 contrast ratio)
  - Primary (navy): White foreground (10:1 contrast ratio)
  - Secondary (sage): White foreground (8:1 contrast ratio)
  - Card (light gray): Dark navy foreground (14:1 contrast ratio)

### Typography System
- **Font Pairing Strategy**: Single-family approach using Inter for both headings and body text with weight variation
- **Typographic Hierarchy**: Clear weight progression (400 body, 500 emphasis, 600 headings, 700 major headings)
- **Font Personality**: Modern, legible, professional, approachable
- **Readability Focus**: Optimal line height (1.5x), generous letter spacing, appropriate measure length
- **Typography Consistency**: Consistent type scale based on mathematical progression
- **Which fonts**: Inter from Google Fonts - professional, highly legible, excellent hinting
- **Legibility Check**: Inter is specifically designed for screen reading with excellent small-size performance

### Visual Hierarchy & Layout
- **Attention Direction**: Primary actions in accent color, secondary in primary color, tertiary in muted tones
- **White Space Philosophy**: Generous spacing to create calm, focused experience with clear content groupings
- **Grid System**: 12-column responsive grid with consistent gutters and breakpoints
- **Responsive Approach**: Mobile-first design with progressive enhancement for larger screens
- **Content Density**: Balanced information richness - detailed when needed, scannable overview by default

### Animations
- **Purposeful Meaning**: Subtle transitions communicate state changes and guide user attention
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Critical actions get more pronounced animation, supporting elements use subtle transitions
- **Contextual Appropriateness**: Professional, subtle animations that enhance rather than distract

### UI Elements & Component Selection
- **Component Usage**: shadcn/ui components for consistent, professional appearance (Cards, Buttons, Tabs, Dialogs)
- **Component Customization**: Custom color mappings to professional palette, consistent border radius system
- **Component States**: Clear hover, active, focus, and disabled states for all interactive elements
- **Icon Selection**: Phosphor Icons for comprehensive, consistent iconography
- **Component Hierarchy**: Primary buttons (accent), secondary buttons (primary), tertiary buttons (outline)
- **Spacing System**: Consistent 4px base unit with harmonious scale (4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64)
- **Mobile Adaptation**: Responsive tabs become stacked navigation, cards stack vertically, touch-friendly sizing

### Visual Consistency Framework
- **Design System Approach**: Component-based design with consistent theming through CSS custom properties
- **Style Guide Elements**: Color palette, typography scale, spacing system, border radius values
- **Visual Rhythm**: Consistent spacing, predictable layouts, harmonious proportions
- **Brand Alignment**: Professional color scheme reinforces trust and competence

### Accessibility & Readability
- **Contrast Goal**: WCAG AA compliance minimum (4.5:1) with AAA preferred (7:1) for primary content

## Edge Cases & Problem Scenarios
- **Potential Obstacles**: AI provider outages, complex regulatory queries, mobile usability
- **Edge Case Handling**: Multi-provider fallback chain, graceful degradation, responsive design
- **Technical Constraints**: Browser compatibility, API rate limits, data persistence requirements

## Implementation Considerations
- **Scalability Needs**: Modular component architecture, efficient state management, persistent data storage
- **Testing Focus**: Component functionality, AI provider fallbacks, responsive design
- **Critical Questions**: How to maintain AI accuracy? How to ensure regulatory content currency?

## Reflection
This approach uniquely combines authoritative regulatory content with intelligent AI assistance, creating a comprehensive compliance support system. The multi-provider AI architecture ensures reliability while the simulation-based learning provides practical application of theoretical knowledge.
